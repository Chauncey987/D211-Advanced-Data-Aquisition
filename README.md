# D211-Advanced-Data-Aquisition
This task focuses on using SQL and a business intelligence tool, such as Tableau, to develop an interactive dashboard that supports executive decision-making by addressing a specific organizational need. The dashboard integrates data from two sources: a provided dataset (churn or medical_data) and an additional external public dataset.

The provided dataset, accessible via PostgreSQL and pgAdmin4 or Tableau in Labs on Demand, offers foundational data, while the external dataset complements and enhances the insights available. The external dataset should be chosen carefully to align with the research question and ensure it adds value to the analysis. Suggested sources for the external dataset include U.S. Census data, Kaggle, or other public data repositories, with a focus on datasets that are publicly available and compliant with usage rights.

The resulting dashboard should combine insights from both datasets through meaningful visualizations and features that allow leaders to explore the data and answer critical questions. This integrated approach provides deeper context and actionable intelligence for organizational decision-making.
